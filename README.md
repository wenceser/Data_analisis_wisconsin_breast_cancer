 Abstract

Breast cancer stands as the most prevalent type of cancer worldwide, as per WHO data (2021). In just the year 2020, there were 2.3 million new diagnoses and approximately 685 thousand deaths, making it a paramount field of medical and technological research to enhance survival rates and women's quality of life.

This study employs various machine learning techniques to analyze a cancer-related dataset, including visual information from fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, and supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are implemented.

The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning models in breast cancer research, focusing on classifying features of abnormal cell nuclei masses.

An exploratory data analysis is performed for the machine learning models, demonstrating favorable performance in terms of precision, sensitivity, and overall accuracy. Additionally, an analysis of feature importance is conducted, exploring the applicability of these models.
